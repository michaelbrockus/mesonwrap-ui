# MesonWrap-UI

## About

* * *

Meson Wrap-UI is a lightweight and developer-friendly GUI that
provides a simplistic way to interact with the venerable Meson
build systems Wrap tool package utility, it is also a
cross-platform application meaning it can run on most common host
systems, and it's the first GUI program built to make upstream
packaging a piece of cake.

The main design goals of Meson Wrap-UI is to provide a standalone
portable GUI and allow the users of the Meson build system to access
all or most of Meson WrapDB tool features with minimal effort.

How would you prefer to make your wrap packages? From a GUI or the
command-line.
